# To-Do List Application – Manual Testing Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates manual testing of a To-Do List web application.
The application was tested based on the visible user interface and available features.

The primary goal of this project is to validate CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations
and identify functional defects through scenario-based testing.

---

## Scope of Testing
- Functional testing of To-Do List features
- CRUD operation validation
- UI-based testing
- Scenario-based testing

Out of scope:
- Backend/API testing
- Performance testing
- Security testing

---

## Test Design Approach
- Test scenarios were designed based on visible UI functionality
- Scenario execution and tracking were done using Trello
- Detailed Excel-based test cases were not created due to the small scope of the application
- Defects were logged and tracked in Trello with proper descriptions

---

## Test Artifacts
- CRUD Test Scenarios
- Defect Reports
- Test Execution Evidence (Trello board screenshots)

---

## Tools Used
- Trello – Test scenario management and defect tracking
- Web Browser – Manual testing

---

## Key Functional Areas Tested
- Add new to-do items
- View all, active, and completed to-do items
- Mark to-do items as completed or active
- Clear completed to-do items
- Validate active item count display

---

## Defects Identified
- Item count does not increment correctly when new to-do items are added
- Incorrect display of “X item(s) left” for active to-do items
- Item count does not show zero when all to-do items are completed

---

## Test Status
- Test scenarios executed
- Defects identified and logged
- Test evidence documented

---

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates practical hands-on experience in manual testing,
including test scenario creation, defect identification, and defect tracking
using industry-relevant tools.
